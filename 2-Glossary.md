It standardizes metadata for Findability and Reusability while providing a uniform, open method for Accessing data. Although it enhances metadata Interoperability, the responsibility for data interoperability remains with the data provider. FDP empowers users to share their data online, similar to how early web servers enabled widespread text publishing.
</p>

### <a name="8afda69dd6c6"></a>**FAIR Principles:**
<p align="justify">
Principles to define the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of resources for humans and computers at the source. For example, the principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data [30].
Findable: Data and supplementary materials have sufficiently rich metadata and a unique and persistent identifier.
Accessible: Metadata and data are understandable to humans and machines. Data is deposited in a trusted repository.
Interoperable: Metadata uses a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
Reusable: Data and collections have a clear usage licence and provide accurate information on provenance [31].
</p>

### <a name="1c9e7af8454e"></a>**Federated data analysis:**
<p align="justify">
Federated data analysis describes an analysis that is performed on multiple (often geographically) separated datasets. During this analysis, the data is not exchanged and can stay, for example, behind a given institution’s firewall. Only the interim results of a local analysis are exchanged between the data-hosting sites [32]. The aggregated non-identifiable results from each local analysis are pooled and returned to the Data User.
</p>

### <a name="c6523f634616"></a>**Federated Query:**
<p align="justify">
A search method executed within the framework of a federated database system that enables simultaneous querying of multiple data sources across multiple systems presenting unified results. The federated search translates the query or queries into different formats which are understandable by each data source, via harmonising data models, schemas and query languages to ensure accurate and comprehensive data retrieval. As a result, users obtain relevant information, such as, the number of subjects that meet a specific criteria through a unified result set.
There are two areas of consideration in federated search:
On the central core services, which consist of the front-end, its back-end, the federated query brokering system, and the certificate storage.
On the provider's side, the query dispatcher, the store, and the data holders customised components to translate the query into the local format.

### <a name="f9468c81b3d5"></a>**Use case:**
<p align="justify">
A use case refers to a specific scenario or situation in which the Cancer Image Europe platform is used to address a real-life scientific or clinical question where access and re-use of large amounts of cancer data can improve patient outcomes. The integration of use cases into the EUCAIM project will outline the technical, ethical and legal steps involved in the process, and will play a crucial role in defining requirements for the implementation of additional cancer image datasets, tools and AI algorithms to improve clinical outcomes.
Example of use case: Identification of imaging biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer.
Scenario: The use case focuses on leveraging the Cancer Image Europe platform to enhance the early detection of breast cancer through the identification of imaging biomarkers. The objective is to develop a robust and efficient AI algorithm to help radiologists in identifying potential malignancies at an early stage.
Steps: 1) Data collection and integration; 2) Training the AI model; 3) Validation of the AI model; 4) Integration in clinical workflows. In this example, a data holder could be a hospital with vast repository of breast imaging data (mammography, MR and  ultrasound images) committed to advancing early cancer detection, intending to incorporate this imaging data into the EUCAIM Infrastructure to contribute to the development of a robust breast cancer detection model; while an AI developers could be a Medtech SME specialised in the development of AI algorithms for healthcare applications aiming to leverage the EUCAIM infrastructure for the development, training, and validation of advanced AI algorithms focused on breast cancer diagnostics.
Expected outcomes: 1) Improved early detection of breast cancer through the identification of relevant imaging biomarkers; 2) Enhanced efficiency in radiology workflows, reducing the time required for manual review; 3) Increased accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions, reducing false positives and unnecessary interventions; 4) Empowerment of healthcare professionals with a valuable decision support tool for more informed clinical decisions.
Who could apply: 1) A data holder, e.g. a hospital with a repository of breast imaging data (mammography, MR and/or ultrasound images) committed to advancing early cancer detection, intending to incorporate this imaging data into the Cancer Image Europe Infrastructure to contribute to the development of a robust breast cancer detection model; 2) AI developers, e.g. a MedTech SME specialised in the development of AI algorithms for healthcare applications aiming to leverage the Cancer Image Europe infrastructure for the development, training, and validation of advanced AI algorithms focused on breast cancer diagnostics.
